While coding the final project app I did find [this Smashing Magazine article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/) to be very useful to use a more modern approach to responsive design. Also, [this article on GIT branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) was incredibly helpful and has interactive tests to help reinforce what you've learned;

A few more resources that I've bookmarked that helped when creating the 301 final project **[PianoGraph](https://github.com/pixeljava/pianograph)**:
- [Preparing a Codebade For Heroku Deployment](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/preparing-a-codebase-for-heroku-deployment)

This [StackOverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3193211/help-me-move-burt-reynolds-face-jquery) wasn't very helpful, but really shows that sometimes you need a second source for your information:
